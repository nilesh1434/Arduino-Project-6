Project 6 - Serial Communication

This code is supposed to turn on/off 2 LED lights with 2 different Buttons (2 commands in 1 board).

I also have another way where I use Serial Monitor to type in inputs (0, 2 to turn off LED 1 and LED 2 respectively and 1, 3 to turn on LED 1 and LED 2 respectively)
